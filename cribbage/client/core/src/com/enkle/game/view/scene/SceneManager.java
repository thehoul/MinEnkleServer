    /**
     * The SceneManager uses a combination of a State and memento pattern.
     *
     * The State pattern is not implemented with an interface, but rather by delegating behaviour to the currently selected state object.
     * In this implementation a Scene represents a state object, and the scene at top of the stack is the selected state object.
     * This implementation allows for new states being created at runtime in the form of scenes with Push(new scene()).
     *
     * The memento pattern is implemented as the Stack of scenes named "scenes", which makes SceneManager act as a proxy for storing objects representing previous states.
     * As new scenes are pushed to the top of the Stack, the old scenes will not render or perform any actions.
     * As the client leaves the current scene by calling Pop(), the previous scene will automatically become active, thus achieving memento.
